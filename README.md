# Women-Stem-Majors

#### To Run

Install bokeh, then execute:

bokeh serve --show major_median_earnings.py

#### Notes/Assumptions: 
There is one instance in the dataset with no information on share of women in Food Science. I've replaced this with an estimate of 50% to avoid NaN values.


Data from fivethirtyeight/data
